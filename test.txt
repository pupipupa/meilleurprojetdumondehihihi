HELLO, World!!!   This    is    a TEST.

C-is GREAT; C is brutal, but BEAUTIFUL.
Some people say: "Why would you ever use C??"
Others reply — because CONTROL, speed, and PAIN.

	Random tabs	are here,	and here,		and here.
Newlines too:
Line one.
Line TWO!!!
Line three???

Numbers: 123 4567, 89.00 — should they stay?
MixOfUpperAndLowerCASEletters EVERYWHERE.

French stuff: L'été, c'est génial!!! Mais l'hiver... bof.
Apostrophes ' should vanish, right?
Quotes "double", ‘single’, weird unicode — boom.

Multiple     spaces      should      maybe      collapse?
Or maybe not — depends on your logic.

End-of-file test here!!!
